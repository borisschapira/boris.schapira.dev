Some economists use the concept of trickling down to justify actions that allow wealthy people to increase their wealth.

Trickle-down, it should be remembered, is the movement of water from areas where it is scarce to areas or reservoirs where it exists in large volumes. As water flows, it carries with it particles of varying size depending on the amount of water in motion and the slope, depleting the land of its essential nutrients. If the run-off continues, soil particles are torn away. This erosion can lead to long-lasting damage to the land.

I think it's a perfect description of what's really happenning.
