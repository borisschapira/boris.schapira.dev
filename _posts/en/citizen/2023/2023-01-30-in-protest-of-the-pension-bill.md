I will be on strike and demonstrating tomorrow, to press on the French governement for the withdrawaof the pension reform bill.

Today, we need to rethink the respective places of work and free time in our lives, giving us back time for ourselves and for others.

I dream of one day being a grandfather who is available to look after his grandchildren, go on vacation with them and help my kids with the challenges of their adult lives. And I want to know that there is another way to do this than to become a rentier.

I owe it to my children to defend their [legacy](/notes/2023-01-legacies/). So I hope we'll get there.
