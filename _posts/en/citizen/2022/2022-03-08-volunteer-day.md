On Friday, I'll teach computers. Not computer science, just how to do basic stuff with files and a spreadsheet.

To you, it may be nothing, but to the staff and residents of the non-profit retirement home I'm helping, it's huge.
And [Contentsquare](https://contentsquare.com/)'s a part of it.

I benefit from the Volunteer Day initiative announced Tuesday by Kat Borlongan, Contentsquare's Chief Impact Officer. Each company employee can take one day out of the year to support an organization whose primary goals are #philanthropy and social welfare.

As part of Volunteer Day, some of my colleagues take time to collect funds or items for Ukraine or to welcome refugees into their homes. Others tutor or counsel teens in crisis, clean up local parks or participate in street outreach.

Most of us won't do this for just one day a year.
But knowing that the company supports us and decides to maintain our pay for one of these days is a very strong sign of responsibility and commitment to the #community, but also to each member of the CSquad.

That's not all. @Contentsquare has also bootstrapped a Gift Matching Program to amplify CSquad's donations. 
I decided to donate ‚Ç¨200 to [UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency](https://www.unhcr.org/fr/). Contentsquare matched that donation 1:1, giving another ‚Ç¨200.

I'm so grateful and I just wanted to say it. üôè
