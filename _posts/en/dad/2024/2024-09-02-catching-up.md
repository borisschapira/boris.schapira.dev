I was waiting for him at the school gate:

> – Come on, Dad, let's go home.  
> – Shouldn't we wait for your brother?  
> – No, we agreed he'd stay to say goodbye to his girlfriend, and I've got other things to do.  
> – Okay... How did your meeting with your principal teacher go?  
> – Well, I was just about to call my best buddy to tell **him**. But you can follow me all the way home, and since I'm very loud and can be heard from a distance, you'll get all the info even if I walk faster than you.

It's too much of an honor…
