We have a useless space in the house that they've turned into a playroom. I can hear them laughing from my office. From the bottom of the stairs, I shout:

> – Are you having fun with your Christmas presents?  
> – Huh?! Well, no!  
> – So what are you doing?  
> – We're reading in the hut!

They had built a cardboard maze with corridors lit by bicycle nightlights, back doors, an opening roof and a desk lamp for the central space. Everything is furnished with old blankets, on which they lie down to read comics.

That's happiness.
