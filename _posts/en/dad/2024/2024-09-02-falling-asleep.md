> – Dad, I can't sleep...  
> – I don't know what to tell you. Did you take a walk, get a glass of water from the kitchen? Is something bothering you? Do you want to talk about it?  
> – Isn't there some kind of medicine?  
> – No, not for children, for one-off cases.  
> – Oh, so it does exist?  
> – On the whole, yes, but we don't have any.  
> – You're… sure?  
> – Well, if you're really motivated, I'll put you in the car and take you to the pharmacy on call. With the round trip alone, I'm sure you'll get some sleep.  
> – Don't bother. I'd rather ask Mom: she's the one who puts everything away anyway, so she must know better than you if we have or not.
