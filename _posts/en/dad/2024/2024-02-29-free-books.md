I achieved a great parenting trick to get the kids to read: I made the kids believe that it's possible to get books without spending their own money, using flattery. 

As a result, I get messages like:

> My little Daddy, you're so wonderful, would you buy me {book}? 

And they think they're the ones who've found a cheatcode!
