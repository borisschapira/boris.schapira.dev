We were preparing to go to my mom's for my birthday. The kids wanted to please me.

> – Dad, you're so old... what did people wear in your time?  
> – Well, we had plaid shirts open over tee-shirts.  
> – Oh that's fun, can we try?

A couple day after:

> – Can we go to school wearing Grinch? It's so stylish!  
> – Grinch?… with the shirt and the tee-shirt?  
> – Yeah, that!
