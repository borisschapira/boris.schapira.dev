10-ans watches the neighbors' cats pass by in the garden:

> – What are you doing?  
> – I'm watching the cats to learn how to be a better tracer.  
> – What do you mean?  
> – Well, they too look at where they want to land, then they run and they jump, it's like us! But at the same time, they're cheating.  
> – How?  
> – We only have abdominals, and even when I use mine at full, I never achieve that kind of moves. Cats, I think they are… made differently. Do you think cats have catbdominals?
