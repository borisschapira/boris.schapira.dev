Discussion with 12yo:

> – Oh, you made this for us?!  
> – Well yes, I think about you boys during the day, a lot. I love you.  
> – I think about you too, Dad. And I love you.  
> – Oh really? When are you thinking about me?  
> – Oh, often. During the day, I'm always like "I hope Daddy doesn't see me!"  
> – Doesn't see you... do what?!  
> – Err no, nothing… hum… do you want some dessert?
