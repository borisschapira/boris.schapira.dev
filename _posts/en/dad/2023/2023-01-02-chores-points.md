My wife and I have installed [the Nipto app](https://nipto.app/) on our phones. It helps us keep score for chores done by the kids. If they do it together, they share the points. If they do it alone, they get points for themselves. They like it a lot, but it makes for some curious discussions:

> – Wait, you set the table while I was taking a shower? But it's not fair, I’m pissed!  
> – Well yeah, but you emptied the dishwasher while I was eating! You didn't wait for me then! That's life, bro, deal with it! And I'm so far ahead after cleaning the toilets, it's over, you'll never catch up!
