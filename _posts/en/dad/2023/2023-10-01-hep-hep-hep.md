My wife intercepts 10yo while he's going downstairs.

> – Hep hep hep!  
> – Oh… okay.

He turns around and goes back to his room, then starts tidying it. I look at her, incredulous:

> – Did you know he hadn't tidied his room?  
> – No, I didn't. I often do this. I "hep hep hep" them, and see how they react. I don't know what they're guilty of. It doesn't matter. **THEY** know.
