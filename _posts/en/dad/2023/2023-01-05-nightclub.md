5 years ago, my sister-in-law got married. Beautiful wedding, reception in a castle. Everything was very well organized. The adults dined and danced in the old wine cellars, converted into a reception room. The children were under the supervision of an animator, in a space of the castle protected from the noise, arranged with games, toys, beds and cuddly toys.

Today, 9-year-old (who was then 4 years old) tells me about it again:

> Well, yeah, you know Dad, when you all wanted to go to the club and you didn't want us kids, so we slept in an abandoned building next door!
