> Dad, what's my favorite dance?

My 5-year-old son asks me.

Caught off guard, I immediately thought of "Single Ladies". We had played the song to him when he was barely an 18-month-old, he had shaken his tiny little butt so much that all the grown-ups had laught out loud.

So we watched the clip again together. Once again, he loved the song and the choreography.

> Woaw, they dance too well. In addition, they have heels and it's very hard to dance with heels, everyone knows that[^heels]! When I grow up, I want to dance just like them!

[^heels]: Especially children who listen to their mother.

Learn respect, there's no age.

He quickly asked me if there were boys dancing with heels. So we spent some time watching videos of Yanis Marshall.
