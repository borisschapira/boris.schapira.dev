My little koala is sick, so I take him to the family doctor. He's seen him a few months earlier for a routine visit before starting soccer trainings. Amazed, he asked him:

> Oh, but you're the soccer doctor?

To which our doctor, so awesome, replied, super cheerful:

> Yes, I'm the soccer and flu doctor.  
> These are my two majors.
