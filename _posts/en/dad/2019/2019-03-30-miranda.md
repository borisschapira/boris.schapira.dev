The Miranda Rights are 5 sentences that anyone who have watched an American TVShow with cops knows pretty well, because they are pronounced systematically during an arrest.

Sometimes I think that we should apply the same thing to children. Can you imagine?

> You have the right – really, I insist – to silence.  
> If you waive this right, anything you say can be questioned, and it better not be a lie.  
> You have the right to let your parents go to the toilet with the door closed.  
> If you can't do this, a roll of toilet paper thrown to your head will automatically be provided.  
> During each whim, you can decide at any time to discontinue and ask for a kiss, a hug, or a quiet time.

I think I'm on to something.
