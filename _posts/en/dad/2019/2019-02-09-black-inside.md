My big one loves Les Bleus. He doesn't really know why - since he's never watched a game before - but he loves Les Bleus. He often repeats that he's Griezmann.

The youngest, who also wants to participate in the role-playing game, has therefore also chosen a hero:

> – If you're Grizemann, I'm Mbappé!  
> – No way! Mbappé he's black!  
> – So what, he's black in his heart?  
> – Uh, no, he's not a bad guy, I don't think so.  
> – Well, then it's okay. We're both not black in our hearts so it's okay, we're the same color!
