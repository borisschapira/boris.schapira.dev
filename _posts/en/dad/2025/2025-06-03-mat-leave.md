CAPSLOCK sees me preparing a parcel for a colleague:

> – Why are you sending her this?  
> – Because she's going on mat' leave soon.  
> – Wait, we can get time off for **this**?!  
> – Of course! We wouldn't want that to happen in the middle of the office!  
> – And how does it work? You ask for time off and poof, you get it? Or does it have to be a complex multiplication? Or maybe it's just for divisions. And what happens if you show your problem to your boss and she can solve it directly?

He had understood "Maths leave".
