One of the messaging services we use in my family allows to create personalized avatars. 14yo and I are having fun creating a personalized avatar for me and as I think it's funny, I send it to my wife and 12yo who are having lunch together.

I get 12yo back a few minutes later.

> â€“ Did Mom mention what I said when she shared your avatar?  
> â€“ Hmm, no.  
> â€“ Well! That's fortunate.
