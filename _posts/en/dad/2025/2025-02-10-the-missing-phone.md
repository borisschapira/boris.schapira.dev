This morning, the little one can't find his phone. The rule is clear: no phone, no independence. The kids only have dumbphones, but it's the only thing they have to keep us informed if they are in need of something.

My wife suggests taking him to school in the morning and his brother, who starts an hour later this morning, propose to come back with him at 4:30 PM.

But on the way to school, he calls me:

> – Dad, there's a problem, actually.  
> – What is it?  
> – Well, I said I finish at 4:30 PM, but actually, I don't.  
> – Did you talk nonsense to your brother?  
> – It's not nonsense. It's a real time, you know, 4:30 PM. Just, it's not the right one.

I'm having a hard time seeing where he's going with this.

> – So, Dad, will you tell him?  
> – What?  
> – Well, that I won't be able to be there.  
> – But how do you want me to do that?  
> – Well, you can send him a message.  
> – On the phone he doesn't have?  
> – Oh yeah, sorry. Well, you can go to the school and tell him then!  
> – But why? You're there, and you'll see each other. Tell him, and I'll come pick him up in the evening.  
> – Oh yeah, that's a plan!

Since I know the little rascal, I ask for confirmation.

> – OK, we have a plan. Repeat the plan to me so I can be sure we agree?  
> – I'm going to talk to him.  
> – Yes…  
> – And I'll tell him that you're coming.  
> – Yes, when?  
> – During the day, to tell him that you'll be back at 4:30 PM!

Arg, so close to the goal!
