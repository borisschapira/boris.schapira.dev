We're talking about career guidance with 14yo, and higher education:

> – So, can I go to Paris[^paris] after my bac[^bac]?  
> – To study in a university?  
> – Well, yeah.  
> – Of course, if it’s the best choice for you at the time. But that also means doing your own shopping, your own laundry…  
> – Oh. And I can’t go with my brother?  
> – No, definitely not. He’ll still be in junior high. And besides, he isn’t going to do your laundry or shopping for you.  
> – Ah… I know! You can just come with me! You could visit your colleagues in Paris!  
> – Hmm… but what if your university is a long way from my work?  
> – But you're a remote worker! It makes no difference for you. You could work from my apartment!  
> – And what about Mom? Does she stay here, all by herself?  
> – Of course not, she’ll have Gabriel [his brother]. Plus, you’ll see her on the weekends!

Then he left the conversation, proud as a rooster, murmuring "Ha ha, I’m just too good at finding solutions!".
