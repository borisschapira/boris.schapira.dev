> – There is a lady at the daycare who says that the rain is Jesus taking a shower.  
> – He must not be happy, God.  
> – Oh yes, because if the water falls to the ground, it is because Jesus puts it everywhere. And his daddy must be angry.  
> – Do you think he's being scolded, Jesus?  
> – Not necessarily. If he knows it's the whole family's bathroom, then Jesus behaves as a good boy and he cleans up after himself.  
> – Oh, yes, you're right. And when the bathroom shines, we see rainbows!
