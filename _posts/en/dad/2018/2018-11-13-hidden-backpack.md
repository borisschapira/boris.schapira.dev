Today, boys in my 5-year-old son's class stole his homemade rainbow backpack that they find "too feminine" to hide it in another class "where there are more girls".

<!-- more -->

Tonight, he's so sad.

> I don't want to so I will not change my backpack or say that I don't love it because… I do.  
> I know I'm not a girl, I don't need them telling me that but…  
> … I would like them to stop mocking me. Dad, do you think that will happen?

I lied, and said what he needed to hear.

He can't understand how proud I am of his attitude, and how sad and angry I am at the same time. Not against those 5-year-old boys, but against their parents and our sick patriacal society.
