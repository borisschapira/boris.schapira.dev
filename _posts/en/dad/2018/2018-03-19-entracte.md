We're taking the kids to a show. There is a small interlude. We sit down with the kids to talk and have a drink.

Our youngest asks:

> – Mom, is the show over?  
> – No, there's the second part. This was just a break, an interlude.  
> – Oh...  
> – An interlude means...  
> – But I know, Mommy, what is an interlude because everytime we watch a cartoon at Grandma's, we take a break to eat candy!
