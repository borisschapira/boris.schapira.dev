Discussion with my 8-year-old:

> â€“ Dad, are you the best?  
> â€“ The best?  
> â€“ With computers.  
> â€“ No, I'm not. It's like cars, you know. Some people know how to build them, others how to drive them. My job is to get these people to talk to each other. If I only talk about the engine or the driving, it doesn't work.  
> â€“ ...  
> â€“ Okay, let me rephrase. If you want to talk to everyone, you have to adapt. But adapting takes energy. So if you spend a lot of time developing the skills you need to talk to everyone, you don't have time to be incredibly good at anything.  
> â€“ ... yeah um, ok. But then, can we say that you're the best... at being average?  
> â€“ Yes, you could say this ðŸ˜…

Turning to his older brother:

> See, I told you Dad was the best!
