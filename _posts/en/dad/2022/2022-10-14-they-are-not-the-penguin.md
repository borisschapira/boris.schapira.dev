You know those nasty but rather funny expressions used to say, without actually saying it, that someone isn't that exceptional?

> – Well, he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer…  
> – Of course, he's not the penguin who slides the furthest!

Tonight, with the boys, we discussed the very particular structure of these expressions: the "He's not", followed by a noun, a preposition "who" or "that".

And of course, between the cheese and dessert, it ended up in a competition for the best original creation. Here are our suggestions:

-   "He's not the strongest trainer in the arena", reference to Pokémon, but it also works by replacing "trainer" by par "blader" (for Beyblade)
-   "He's not the oven that heats up the most"
-   "He's not the guitar that sounds best"
-   "He's not the grape that makes the best wine"
-   "He's not the sweetest candy in the packet"
-   "He's not the plumber who breaks the most bricks", _here we go!_
-   "He's not the hedgehog with the most spikes" or "He's not the hedgehog with with most rings" (a reference to Sonic)
-   "He's not the marble that rolls the furthest"
-   "He's not the elephant with the biggest ears"
-   "He's not the computer that calculates the fastest"
-   "He's not the crunchiest M&M's in the pack"

We have also received suggestions on social networks:

-   "He's not the most oxygenated trout in the river"
-   "He's not the pebble that makes the most ricochets"
-   "He's not the brightest candle on the stick"
-   "He's not the sharpest arrow in the quiver"
-   "He's not the closest electron to the nucleus" (this one, you need a certain level of skill)

Special mention to:

-   "He is not the least scandal-ridden minister", which shows that we have set the bar very low in our political ideals.
