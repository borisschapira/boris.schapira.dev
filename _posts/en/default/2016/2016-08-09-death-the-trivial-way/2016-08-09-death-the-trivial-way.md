> On the one hand, it’s possible we’ll develop ASI that’s like a god in a box, bringing us a world of abundance and immortality. But on the other hand, it’s very likely that we will create ASI that causes humanity to go extinct in a quick and trivial way.

Even if I've studied it, I've never been interested by AI before. As the computer power continue to grow, I think that it may be possible we achieve <abbr title="Artificial General Intelligence: a computer as intelligent as a human">AGI</abbr>, even accidental <abbr title="Artificial Super Intelligence: a computer with an intelligence so much above ours that we wouldn't understand">ASI</abbr>, by the end of my lifetime.

We need to discuss about it.
