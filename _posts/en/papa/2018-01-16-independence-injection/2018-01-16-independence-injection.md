At home, my main job is to keep the kids from overflowing our home and give them context so that they can position themselves. 

I'm a parent container.

{% capture alt_text%}Video explanation of CSS absolute positioning.{% endcapture %}
{% include video_as_a_gif.html.liquid
    slug="absolute"
    alt=alt_text
    caption="&quot;I am absolute&quot;"
%}
