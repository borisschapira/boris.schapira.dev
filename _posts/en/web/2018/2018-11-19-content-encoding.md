Improving the speed at which a web page is displayed often means making the
browserâ€™s life as easy as possible. When the browser receives an HTTP response,
it actually receives text encoded in bytes, where each byte or sequence of bytes
represents a given character. If the browser does not have a clear information
about the used encoding, it will waste time trying to guess and may fail in some
cases.

Although the Web is intended to be universal, the various human groups that use
it have their own specificities. One of these specificities is language,
especially when written. All textual content is composed of characters from a
directory intended for a type of use. Hiraganas, for example, are phonetic
system intended for the unambiguous transcription of the Japanese language.

To be able to designate each character unambiguously, we must assign a unique
identifier to each of them. The whole set of identifiers will be called a
character set. Once this correspondence table has been defined, each character
need be converted into a sequence of bytes so that we can store or share them
between computers. This is called character encoding.

Imagine that I use a character set to write text and a corresponding encoding to
convert it to bytes, which I later send to you. How would you decode it, and
read the content, without knowing which encoding, or set, I used? Eventually,
you would have to use some of the most common character set & encodings you
know, expecting the result to make senseâ€¦ What could go wrong?

So yeahâ€¦ not a great idea.

For example, the bit sequence 1100 0011 1010 1001 represents the character "Ã©"
in the UTF-8 encoding. If you decode this sequence assuming you have to use the
Latin-1 encoding and not UTF-8, you will read "Ãƒ Â©".  
In Latin-1, the character "Ã©" is represented by the sequence 1110 1001.

When the browser receives bytes from your server, it needs to identify the
collection of letters and symbols that were used in writing the text that was
converted into these bytes, and the encoding used for this conversion, in order
to reverse it. If no information of this kind has been transmitted, the browser
will try to find recognizable patterns within the bytes to determine the
encoding itself, and eventually try some common charsets, which will take time,
delaying further processing of the page.

To speed up the display of your pages, you must specify the content encoding
into your HTTP response.

## How to choose the right character set?

There was a time when hundreds of character encodings coexisted, all limited and
not able to contain enough characters to cover all the languages of the world.
Sometimes, no encoding was adequate for all letters in a single language.

Nowadays, Unicode â€“ a universal character set, defining all the characters
necessary to write the majority of languages â€“ has become a standard, no matter
what platform, device, application or language youâ€™re targeting. UTF-8 is one of
the Unicode encodings and the one that should be used for Web content, according
to the W3C:

> Everyone developing content, whether content authors or programmers, should
> use the UTF-8 character encoding, unless there are very special reasons for
> using something else. (If you decide to not use UTF-8, you must choose one of
> the few encodings that are interoperably implemented across all browsers.)  
> <cite>"[Introducing Character Sets and Encodings](https://www.w3.org/International/getting-started/characters)",
> W3C</cite>

_Note: if youâ€™re using a database to store your content on the server side, you
may be tempted to also use the "utf-8" charset too. Beware: on MySQL and
MariaDB, itâ€™s an alias for "utf8mb3", a UTF-8 encoding called "Basic
Multilingual Plane" â€“ or BMP â€“ that only stores a maximum of three bytes per
code point. Instead, youâ€™d rather use "utf8mb4", an encoding that stores a
maximum of four bytes per code point. Otherwise, you wonâ€™t be able to use some
popular characters, such as ðŸš€, otherwise known as "U+1F680 ROCKET"!_

## How to advertise your character encodingâ€¦ and the best way to do it.

Before going any further, letâ€™s take a look at the vocabulary in use.

We find this use of "character set" or "charset" to designate, in reality, an
encoding, in the HTML specifications. We will do the same in the rest of this
article.

One of the easiest ways to specify a charset in an HTML page is to put in a
`<meta>` tag in the element:

```
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

Declaring a character set this way
[requires certain constraints to be respected](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/document-metadata.html#specifying-the-documents-character-encoding),
one of them being that the element containing the character encoding declaration
must be serialized completely within the first 1024 bytes of the document, to
ensure that the browser will receive the information with the first IP packets
transiting through the network and can use it to decode the rest of the
document. As the charset `<meta>` tag is the only one with this kind of
requirement, the most common tip is to place it directly after the element
opening tag:

```
<html â€¦>
  <head â€¦>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
```

If youâ€™re afraid to forget this, donâ€™t worry. This is obviously one of the
checks that Dareboost will perform for you within our
[website quality analysis tool](https://www.dareboost.com/en/tool/website-analysis).
However, you may find yourself in a situation where this declaration is not
sufficient, and the browser does not take it into account. Why? Because the
Content-Type metadata of the page may indicate another character set and in the
event of a conflict, this information â€“ defined in the page HTTP headers â€“ has
priority.

To make sure of the information transmitted through the page metadata, you can
use
[our Timeline / Waterfall feature](https://www.dareboost.com/en/doc/analysis-report/timeline-waterfall).
Unfold the detailed values of your main document to view the response HTTP
headers, including the Content-Type header, containing the encoding metadata.

{% capture img_alt %}Content Type Header in an HTTP response{% endcapture %}
{% include rwd-image.html.liquid
path="/assets/images/2018-11-16/content-type.png"
alt=img_alt
%}

To change this HTTP header, you may need the help of the person who managed the
server, whereas itâ€™s your hosting service provider or a person in charge in your
organization, because the configuration of the HTTP headers is very specific to
the web server in use, and youâ€™ll need the appropriate administrative rights to
be able to modify those server settings.

On **Apache 2.2+**, the configuration of UTF-8 as a default character set for
your `text/plain` and `text/html` files involves
[the `AddDefaultCharset` directive](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/en/mod/core.html#adddefaultcharset):

```
AddDefaultCharset utf-8
```

For other types of files, you'll need
[the `AddCharset` directive](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/mod/mod_mime.html#addcharset);

```
AddCharset utf-8 .js .css â€¦
```

On **nginx**, youâ€™ll need to make sure that
[the ngx_http_charset_module is loaded](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_charset_module.html),
then use the `charset` directive.

```
charset utf-8;
```

Here too, it is possible to refine the scope so that other types of files than
`text/html` are delivered in utf-8, using the directive `charset_types`:

```
charset_types text/html text/css application/javascript
```

Of course, you can also configure the `Content-Type` HTTP header from your
server-side scripting code. For example, in **PHP**, you can use
[the header() network function](https://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php).
Donâ€™t forget to define the Media Type (or MIME type) of the body of the
response, in addition to the character set.

```
header('Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8');
```

_Beware: if your pages are delivered by a Content Delivery Network (CDN), you
may have to configure the `Content-Type` header in the CDN configuration, as
most of them donâ€™t pass on the headers they find on your servers._
