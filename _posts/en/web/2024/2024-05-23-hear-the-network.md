Here's a good way to raise awareness through audio: [Netbeep](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/netbeep/hcgpboeddcgldkgimfmcnfloonkccfmi) is a Chrome extension that plays a sound for each network request, depending on the type of content and the domain called. The pitch of the sound is higher for larger files.

A good way to activate synesthesia. By relying on sound rather than sight to convey information that would otherwise be invisible on the screen, this extension enables you to understand how a page is loaded.

On a single page, it's hard to get much out of it. But when you start using it on several sites, you quickly notice the differences.

If anyone has a Firefox equivalent, I'd be happy to add it to this post.
