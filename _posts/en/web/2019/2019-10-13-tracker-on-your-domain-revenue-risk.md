## 1<sup>st</sup> Party Trackers

Here is the introduction you can read on the page
"[How To Avoid Missing Out On Data Due to GDPR TO AVOID MISSING OUT ON DATA DUE TO GDPR](https://www.eulerian.com/en/blog/tricks/avoid-missing-data-due-to-gdpr/)"
on Eulerian's blog, one of the leading solutions for attribution (meaning,
tracking).

If you didn't understand the rhetoric, it's simply a question of how to get
around the lack of consent of Internet users (or even the clear expression of
their non-consent when they install adblockers) to collect data anyways. The
proposed "solution": hide the dirt under the carpet by hiding the script in a
sub-domain of the brand.

For example, instead of sending data to `my_domain.eulerian.net`, the
organization sends it to `43bdf.my_domain.com` and then ensures that
`43bdf.my_domain.com` points to `my_domain.eulerian.net`.

The amount of ethical issues raised by this practice is significant, but it also
raises security issues since, if not properly implemented, the manipulation can
leak session data to a third party, leading to usurpation of the user session,
critical data theft or defacing of the platform. A risk that tracking solutions
providers are careful not to highlight.

## A "Slow Page" Badge on Chrome?

Google has announced that they're going to experiment a badge to penalize slow
sites.

Experiments of this type had already been carried out in 2015.
"<span lang="en">Slow To Load</span>" and "<span lang="en">Red Slow
Label</span>" badges have been
[displayed on search results](http://www.redslowlabel.com/). This time,
[Google advertises starting experiments in Chrome](https://blog.chromium.org/2019/11/moving-towards-faster-web.html).

when loading a slow moving page, the loading bar would be blue and the loading
screen would display a warning badge. When loading a potentially fast page, the
bar would be green.{% endcapture %} {% include rwd-image.html.liquid

Since the end of the 2000s, Google has multiplied initiatives around Web
Performance. Since 2017, however, I have felt an acceleration, probably due to
their desire to index the Web more accurately using probes
[always equipped with the latest version of Chrome and running JavaScript](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/05/the-new-evergreen-googlebot.html).
A tendency around which new indicators have even been created, such as the
[Time To (Consistently) Interactive](https://blog.dareboost.com/fr/2019/05/mesurer-interactivite-time-to-interactive/)
which, while not being a good UX indicator, is an excellent end-of-load
indicator for a bot.

## If the law does not prevail, money will

If you work in an organization that is considering masking third parties in a
1<sup>st</sup> Party domain, please **don't**, for ethical and security reasons.

If this is not enough for you, know that you will quickly lose experienced users
who will develop and equip themselves with software that detect these scripts
despite your manipulations, and will refuse to support these usages.

If you are still not convinced, I encourage you to
[carefully monitor your Web Performance](https://www.dareboost.com/fr/). If
these third parties respond slowly, then it would slow Google's perception of
your entire domain.

We already know that
[the degradation of Web Performance has an impact on ranking](https://blog.dareboost.com/fr/2018/01/google-speed-update-vitesse-ranking/).
With Chrome's experiments, it will have an explicit impact on visits to your
entire domain. We are no longer talking about people who will think that their
connection may be temporarily poor, but about people who **will be notified by
Google that your site is slow**, and will leave.

Do you really want to take that risk?
