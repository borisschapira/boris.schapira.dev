A few month ago, I published a blog post about
[increasing Netflix videos' brightness](/2018/08/bookmark-netflix-brightness/)
and people seems to really dig it. But what if you really need to speed up your
current episode to finish it before your bae arrives or slow down Beyonc√©'s
moves to better learn one of her routine in HOMECOMING? No problem.

<!-- more -->

**Click and drag the following link in your favorites**:

<!-- nomicrotypo -->
<a href="javascript:(function(){var b=Number(prompt('Video playback rate?','1'))%7C%7C1;Array.from(document.getElementsByTagName('video')).forEach(function(a){a.playbackRate=b;a.play()})})();" title="Manage Video Playback Rate">Manage Video Playback Rate</a>
<!-- endnomicrotypo -->

Then go to Netflix, HBO Now, Hulu, or pretty much any streaming service using
HTML videos[^1], launch your favorite series or movie, and click it!

    As explained in [the previous post](/2018/08/bookmark-netflix-brightness/),
    if the website has defined a Content-Security-Policy blocking bookmarks,
    this won't work, sorry!

And if you want to manage both brightness and video playback rate without
multiplying bookmarks, here's one that do both:

<!-- nomicrotypo --><a href="javascript:(function(){var c=Number(prompt('Video playback rate?','1'))%7C%7C1,a=prompt('Video brightness?','100%');a=/^\d+(\.\d+)?%$/.test(a)?a:'100%';Array.from(document.getElementsByTagName('video')).forEach(function(b){b.playbackRate=c;b.play();b.setAttribute('style',b.getAttribute('style')+'filter: brightness('+a+');')})})();" title="Manage Video Brightness and Playback Rate">Manage Video Brightness and Playback Rate</a><!-- endnomicrotypo -->

Feel free to rename the bookmark with shorter labels. For example, I use the ‚òÄÔ∏è
(sun) and üèÉ‚Äç (running) emojis (and only that).
