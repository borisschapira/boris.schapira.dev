The usual web performance metrics (First Byte, Speed Indexâ€¦) are very
interesting but I often need to add custom temporal markers, based on events
that make sense from a business point of view.

I use the User Timing API
([see on <abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network">MDN</abbr>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User_Timing_API))
to create named timestamps that belong to the browser's performance timeline. As
I can retrieve this timeline in Dareboost, I can
[track their evolution over time](https://blog.dareboost.com/en/2018/05/custom-timings-monitoring/).

{% capture img_alt %}Two curves in a graph. On the x-axis, a date range of one
month. On the Y-axis, the time between 0 and 3s. The orange curve shows timing
"mark_declare_js_end" while the green curve corresponds to timing
"mark_switchlang_end".{% endcapture %} {% capture img_caption %}Some Custom

Using the API in JavaScript is quite simple (and
[broadly supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=user-timing)), for example:

```js
// The thing you want to monitor the occurrence of
document.getElementById('content').classList.add('blue');
// The timestamp
performance.mark('mark-blue');
```

You can then retrieve the value in your browser developers tools, using:

```
performance.getEntriesByType('mark');
```

However, I recently[^1] realized that I often forgot something important: **just
because the browser execute some JavaScript code does not mean that the user can
see the results of this execution**. The browser must update the display, and
its ability to do so depends on the JavaScript code that follows the piece of
code we're interested in.

In the following example, I inject a 1-second blocking loop after my performance
mark, preventing the browser to update of the display.

```js
// The thing you want to monitor the occurrence of
document.getElementById('content').classList.add('blue');
// The timestamp
performance.mark('mark-blue-sync');

// A snippet of code that consumes resources during 1 second
let n = performance.now();
while (performance.now() - n < 1000) {}
```

Of course, in real life, you won't have a simple loop. You will have other tasks
that may or may not take a long time. You can't know it and, in fact, you can't
even test it, because it all depends on the customer context that you don't
control.

To get around this problem, we can use `requestAnimationFrame()` to ask for our
mark to be put set before the browser performs the next repaint:

```js
// The thing you want to monitor the occurrence of
document.getElementById('content').classList.add('blue');
performance.mark('mark-blue-sync');
// The timestamp, before the next repaint
window.requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    performance.mark('mark-blue-frame');
});

// A snippet of code that consumes resources during 1 second
// but we don't care anymore
let n = performance.now();
while (performance.now() - n < 1000) {}
```

If you want to see this for yourself, here's
[a test page](https://tests.boris.schapira.dev/perfmark-animationframe/).

{% capture note %} **IN A NUTSHELL**

**Call the User Timings API** to create custom business-related timestamps.

**Encapsulate them** inside `requestAnimationFrame()` callbacks to get to
understand how the UI behaves, rather than the code execution.

If you want to have an idea of the display latency, attach two marks: one after
the event to be followed, the other in a `requestAnimationFrame()`
callback.{% endcapture note %} {% include note.html.liquid content=note %}
