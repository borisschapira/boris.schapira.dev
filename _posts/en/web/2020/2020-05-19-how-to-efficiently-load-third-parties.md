Embedding an existing library or service as a third party can increase
productivity, but often has a cost on perceived performance. Once you embed
external code, how can you ensure that this code will not affect the performance
and interactivity of your site? Here are some ideas for a more efficient third
party code.

Building a Front-End Web project is about fulfilling a set of business
requirements through code. You can produce this code yourself or transfer this
responsibility to libraries or services that have already proven themselves on
the market.

When you reference one of these libraries or services from a web page rather
than embedding it in your code, neither you nor the browser of the visitor has
control over this resource, since it is produced, managed and hosted by a third
party vendor. These are called "Third Party" (or "3p") resources.

## How does it work?

Using third-party resources, in HTML, is usually done through the `<script>` tag
(which allows you to load and execute a script), `<link>` tag (which references
resources later needed by the page) and `<iframe>` tag (which creates a
completely different navigation context within the page). They are very commonly
used.

According to
[the Web Almanac 2019](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/third-parties),
 93% of desktop pages include at least one third-party resource and nearly 76%
of these pages query an analytics domain (such as Google Analytics, for
example).

Third parties can concern a wide variety of areas: advertising, analytics,
customer relationship, social network integration, marketing, user management,
videos... Very often, references to these resources are gathered in a
[tag manager](https://blog.dareboost.com/en/2018/04/how-tag-managers-impact-web-performance/),
which centralizes their management and provides an entry point for
[discussions about the third parties](https://blog.dareboost.com/en/2018/06/tag-manager-web-performance-best-practices/)
used on the page.

Using third parties increases the productivity of your development teams (who
delegate some features to these third parties). On the other hand, this will
increase your operational cost, since you may have to pay for a software
license, and most certainly monitor the proper functioning of this software
component that you no longer have control over.

Note that you generally cannot request any changes to the way the third-party
resources or services you use work: the fact that these resources are used by a
very large number of sites means that the publisher is sheltered from individual
pressures.

## What about performance?

While often criticized, third parties have an impact on rendering and usage
performance that it is important to balance. If we take, for example, the most
common JS libraries, served as third parties by CDNs: they are among the most
efficiently delivered resources, with efficient minification and obfuscation,
often coupled with low-latency CDNs. Although their use often degrades the Start
Render, this is more often because
[these scripts are loaded synchronously](/notes/2017-12-defer-script-to-speed-up-rendering/)
rather than to their third-party status.

The biggest impact on performance comes from ads and social network scripts
which cost on the network and performance is rarely outweighed by the features
they provide to users, at least during the initial page loading phase.

One example is Facebook's "Like" button. Its interest from a user experience
perspective is debatable, and it is certainly not relevant until the user has
seen the content of the page. You should therefore always load it "lazyly"
(late, in the process of loading the page).

Quite often, once you have assessed the relevance of your third parties and
their respective loading modalities, you will certainly discover that the way
you load your third parties can be optimized.

## Delaying a resource or service loaded too soon.

When a third-party resource (or several) is loaded before all the critical
elements of the page have been displayed and became interactive, you may want to
delay them. An example would be the loading of Youtube videos, located below the
fold, consuming bandwidth even when they are not visible.

In this case, it will be necessary to revise the declaration of the `<script>`,
`<link>` or `<iframe>` responsible for the inclusion of the third party resource
in the site, so that this inclusion occurs later, deferred: either in reaction
to an event raised during the loading of other resources or after an event
provoked by the user (an issue of Lazy-Loading already discussed for
[the loading of images](/notes/2019-03-lazy-loading-faster-webpages-seo-friendly/)).

## Prioritizing a resource or service that is too late in the queue

If you are using third parties to define or improve the design (fonts, JS
scripts that define the dimensions of elements in the layout), or even to
retrieve part of the content to be displayed, you will want to prioritize their
loading and usage. However, very often, the use of these resources is slowed
down by:

-   the **DNS resolution** of the origin that hosts them
-   the **connection** to this origin
-   the **downloading** of these resources

How to tell the browser the behavior to adopt to optimize their loading? Have a
look at
[my previous article on Preload and Resource Hints](/notes/2020-05-preload-prefetch-preconnect-resource-hints/)!

## The Googles Fonts case

When it comes to web fonts, Google Fonts are predominant: according to the Web
Almanac 2019 (["Fonts" chapter](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2019/fonts)),
at least 74% of web font requests come from Google Fonts, and 29% of pages
contain a link to a Google Fonts CSS style sheet.

This type of request presents a real risk because the loading of a CSS
stylesheet is synchronous. The browser interrupts the rendering of the page
while it requests, downloads, and analyzes the CSS file. The request represents
a Single Point of Failure (SPOF): if there is no response, then the page remains
frozen. It is very easy to
[simulate such a failure with Dareboost](https://www.dareboost.com/en/doc/website-speed-test/settings/dns-mapping-blackhole)
(targeting fonts.googleapis.com).

To mitigate this, you can use asynchronous loading techniques based on
[attribute alterations](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler/) or
[JavaScript libraries](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS) that expose the
life cycle of your fonts.

A simpler optimization is to download Google Fonts. A feature offered natively
on the Google Fonts site but also available via
[Mario Ranfti's Google Webfont Helper tool](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts)
which will help you generate the CSS file to declare them.

By doing so, however, you will lose the benefit of Google Fonts content
negotiation,
[detailed in this article by Barry Pollard](https://www.tunetheweb.com/blog/should-you-self-host-google-fonts/).
In short: Google Fonts optimizes the CSS file it delivers to provide the right
font formats and character sets for the requesting browser.

At the moment, the best solution may be to use a resource proxy. On the surface,
these are **your** sub-domains that serve the third-party resources you need.
Under the hood, they are web applications that perform resource fetching and
caching on external domains, filtering the information sent to those domains (
forwarding what is relevant for content negotiation but not privacy-related
data). With such a tool, you serve fonts from your domain, while benefiting from
Google Fonts content negotiation. This technique, also available for JavaScript
scripts, is well described in this article from Decitre Tech team:
"[Limiting the damage of third party JS loading [FR]](https://tech.decitre.fr/posts/optimiser-chargement-js-tiers)".

Cette technique, complexe, n’est pas à la portée de tout le monde. Une
alternative est donc d’utiliser un mélange de `preload` (pour la feuille de
style CSS) et de `preconnect` (au domaine servant les polices) pour bénéficier
de la meilleur optimisation possible. Harry Roberts traite ce sujet en détail
dans un article paru aujourd’hui-même :
"[The Fastest Google Fonts](https://csswizardry.com/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/)".

## Conclusion

Third-party resources or services provide features to your site, but the way
they are loaded may negatively impact the user experience. To optimize their
usage, start by determining the tradeoffs that need to be made to prioritize
each item. Once these priorities are determined, then you can delay or
prioritize third-party loading to get the most out of it, sometimes by
delivering them through your domain (first-party), either directly or through a
proxy.
