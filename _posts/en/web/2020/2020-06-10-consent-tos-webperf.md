Let's imagine that you deploy on your site a consent collection mechanism tied
to your Terms and Conditions of Use (TC). This consent is generally structured
around different purposes: consent to telemetry, consent to advertising, consent
to the transmission of information to third parties...

If you want to finely measure the impact of these different "levels of consent"
on Web Performance, then you need to look at all the use cases, depending on the
relationship the subject has with your site.

1. The user blocks the consent request script (via an adblocker, for example).
2. The user has given their consent to this version of the TC.
3. This user has given their consent to a previous version of the TC, you need
   to ask for their consent again.
4. The user has explicitly refused their consent to this version of the TC.
5. The user has explicitly refused their consent; you could ask for their
   consent again (at your own risk).

Case number 3 can give rise to a significant amount of testing as you should
ideally test all consent combinations: "telemetry", "telemetry +
advertisements", "advertisements only" .

**To simplify**, you can focus on the two most extreme use cases:

1. What happens if the user refuses or does not consent?
2. What happens if the user consent to all usages?

Very often, the acceptance of all uses leads to a situation where the user
experience is disastrous, and users are not offered any new feature to
compensate for this degradation of their experience.

This is an opportunity for Product Managers to reflect on the ethics of this
type of implementation. Is it normal that **we offer the most degraded
experience to our most loyal users**?
