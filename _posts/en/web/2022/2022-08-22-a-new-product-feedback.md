When I come up with a product feedback that could lead to a product improvement:

Between what I think,  
What I want to say,  
What I think I say,  
What I say,  
What the product department wants to hear,  
What it hears,  
What it understands,  
How the POs conduct the discovery stage with users,  
What other users want to hear,  
What they hear,  
What they understand,  
What they express,  
What designers want to hear,  
What they hear,  
What they understand,  
What they experience with users to refine the need,  
The UX that comes out of it,  
How it is communicated to the technical team,  
What the technical team wants to hear,  
What they hear,  
What they are able to implement within the constraints,  
The deadlines they communicate,  
How they are received by the operational teams,  
What the operational teams wanted to hear,  
What they understand,  
What had to be explained to the sales team,  
What the sales team wants to hear,  
What they understand,  
How they plan to sell it,  
What the customer wants to hear,  
What they hear,  
What they understand,  
What they buy,  
And the uses to which they will be trained by the Customer Success team...

â€¦ there's still a good chance we'll have trouble communicating. 

But let's try anyway!
