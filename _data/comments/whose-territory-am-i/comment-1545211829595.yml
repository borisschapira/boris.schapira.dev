  This reminds me of a blog post I had written about this: "[We, the robots](http://la-grange.net/2011/05/17/robots.xhtml.en)".
  
  We are defined by our experiences and encounters. Algorithms are exposed to a certain type of content, hence we are modeled through these exposures. Following the directions on Google Maps is a convenience, but it is also an abandon of your will, and can lead to certain type of accidents. This is very different than following a track on a paper map for example and define your trajectory, route with criteria you are not even conscious of in the first place. A forest color, a shade of mountains, a name of a village are sources of serendipity, which are estranged to algorithms made for optimizing. Optimizations lead to a common uniform "us", the robots.
