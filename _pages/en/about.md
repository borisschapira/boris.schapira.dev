## nice to meet you

I'm a french engineer[^1], Customer Success Manager for
[Dareboost](https://www.dareboost.com/en/ 'Website speed test, Website quality analysis - Dareboost').
Dareboost is a <abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr> auditing service
that analyse your website's quality and performances. My role is to analyse
customer journey(s) by gathering feedbacks, then check with customers to ensure
that they are on track with their performance objectives and, if not, see if I
can help with an even broader use of Dareboost.

You may have meet me during events or conferences, talking about Service Design,
Finance, e-Commerce or the choice of a data management solution :

Specializing in Quality management, Web performance and mobile Web, I'm thrilled
about understanding the challenges of the new usages and experiences of the
users.

I care a lot, so [I also share a lot](/en/about/sharing/).
