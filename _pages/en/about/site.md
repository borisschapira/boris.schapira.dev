## Under the hood

Specialized in Web Performance for a few years, I decided one day not to be the
barefoot cobbler. Since then, in a healthy competition with my former
colleague[Nicolas Hoizey](http://nicolas-hoizey.com/), I've never ceased to
improve the web performance of the website.

### Server side

I started by throwing away my Wordpress blog and replacing it with a static site
generator[^static] developped in node, [Hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo).
After having determined the limits of the tool and contributed to some plugins,
I decided to migrate to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) whose community seemed
more mature to me.

    Frank Taillandier has beautifully sketched the
    [static movement [FR]](http://frank.taillandier.me/2016/03/08/les-gestionnaires-de-contenu-statique/)
    on his blog.

My Ruby dependencies are managed by [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) :

-   for the archive management : `jekyll-archives` ;
-   to generate responsive images layout : `jekyll-cloudinary` ;
-   for the `sitemap.xml` : `jekyll-sitemap` ;
-   regarding pagination : `jekyll-paginate-v2` ;
-   the micro-typography is managed by : `jekyll-microtypo`.

I probably forget some of them, but you can find all the dependencies
[on my Github repo](https://github.com/borisschapira/boris.schapira.dev/blob/prod/Gemfile 'Jekyll code for boris.schapira.dev').

Internationalization is enabled by `i18n` and the `i18n_filter`[^2].

[^2]:
    The localization technique is detailed in the
    [Thomas Brelet's Jekyll Starter Guide [FR]](http://www.toam.fr/20-05-2013-guide-demarrage-jekyll/#localiser-jekyll).

I use [node](https://nodejs.org/) to compile my CSS and JS static resources.

### Compilation and deployment

My pages and articles are written in [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), a
light syntax which is ideal for writing[^3]. I use the Github hooks to interface
my repository with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), that executes some tests
with [rspec](http://rspec.info/) and compiles the site.

The generated site is then tested via
[html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) to check that the
pages are error-free.

If all goes well then Netlify deploys the generated site on its
<abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr>.

The last deployment was carried out on {{ site.time | l: '%A %-d %B %Y' }}.

Netlify is also in charge of capturing comments and sending them to a private
Slack channel via [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/),
using
[a technique popularized by Phil Hawksworth](https://github.com/philhawksworth/jamstack-comments-engine).

### Client side

Part of my CSS and JS code is dedicated to accessibility and I also try to
contribute responsibly, to be as inclusive as possible, keeping both people and
contexts in mind (for example, I use the
[abbr-touch library](http://www.growingwiththeweb.com/2014/09/making-abbr-elements-touch-accessible.html)
that gives mobile users the ability to read the definition of an abbreviation or
acronym.

The instant search is achieved by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), a very
efficient indexing and search solution that has the advantage of offering an
[example implementation for Jekyll](https://blog.algolia.com/instant-search-blog-documentation-jekyll-plugin/ 'Add instant search to your blog or documentation using our Jekyll plugin')
that fits perfectly with my needs.

In order to control what is happening on my site (including detecting attempted
injections), I have configured specific directives in my
[Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9curit%C3%A9/CSP)
and reports are recorded in <https://report-uri.com/>[^7].

A daily monitoring via [Dareboost](https://www.dareboost.com/) on several pages
informs me of possible performance regressions through configured alerts.
