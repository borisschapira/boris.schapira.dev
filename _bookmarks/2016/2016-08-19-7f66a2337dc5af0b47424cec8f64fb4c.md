&quot;PowerShell is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux and OS X) automation and
configuration tool/framework that works well with your existing tools and is
optimized for dealing with structured data (e.g. JSON, CSV, XML, etc.), REST
APIs, and object models. It includes a command-line shell, an associated
scripting language and a framework for processing cmdlets.&quot; <br>&#8212;
