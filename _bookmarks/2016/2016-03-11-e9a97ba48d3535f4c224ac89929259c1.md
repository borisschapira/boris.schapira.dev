&quot;Social media hasnâ€™t just swallowed journalism, it has swallowed
everything. It has swallowed political campaigns, banking systems, personal
histories, the leisure industry, retail, even government and security. The phone
in our pocket is our portal to the world. I think in many ways this heralds
enormously exciting opportunities for education, information, and connection,
but it brings with it a host of contingent existential risks.&quot; <br>&#8212;
