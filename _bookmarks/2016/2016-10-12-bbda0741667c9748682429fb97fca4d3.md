&quot;JavaScript is great, and by all means use it, while also being aware that
you can build so many functional UI components without the additional
dependancy.<br /> <br /> Maybe you can include a few lines of utility code, or a
mixin, and forgo the requirement. If you're only targeting more modern browsers,
you might not need anything more than what the browser ships with.&quot;
