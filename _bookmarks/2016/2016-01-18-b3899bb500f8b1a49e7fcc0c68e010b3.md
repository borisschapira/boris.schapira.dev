&quot;If you read the jQuery 3.0 alpha blog post, you might remember that we
announced something we called “jQuery Compat”. You can forget that. On January
12, Microsoft dropped support for IE8, IE9, and IE10. We’re not going to go that
far just yet, but we are dropping support for IE8.&quot; <br>&#8212;
