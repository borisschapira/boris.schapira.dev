&quot;There is no such thing as disconnected information, no matter where you
look – people, events, places, things, documents, applications and the
information about them is all heavily connected. As the volume of data grows, so
does the number and dynamicity of its connections. And if you’ve tried in the
past to store and query that highly connected, semi-structured data in any
database, you probably experienced a lot of challenges.&quot; <br>&#8212;
