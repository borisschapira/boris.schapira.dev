&quot;CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is
a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike
flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by
applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container)
and to that elements children (which become Grid Items).&quot; <br>&#8212;
