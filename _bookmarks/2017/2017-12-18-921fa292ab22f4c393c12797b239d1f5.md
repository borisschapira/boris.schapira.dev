So which method should you use to load your webfonts? Unfortunately the answer
is it depends:<br /> <br />

-   If you’re looking for a quick and simple method you can have working within
    an hour, use Amazon’s method<br />
-   If you want something a bit more thorough and are alright with the limited
    browser support for now, try using font-display: optional<br />
-   And if you really want to make an effort to optimize your webfont loading,
    take the dive and look into the localStorage technique <br>&#8212;
