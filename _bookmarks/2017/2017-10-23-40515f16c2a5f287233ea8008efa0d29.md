&quot;Itâ€™s time to take a new approach on how you design the email field. The
solution is not another field to fill out, but to give clarity to the existing
field. Prominent placement, larger input size and a specific label are what you
need. Make this change and kill the email confirmation field once and for
all.&quot; <br>&#8212;
