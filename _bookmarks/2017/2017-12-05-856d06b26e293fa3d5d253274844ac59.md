&quot;Image placeholders in SVG are ready for prime time thanks to browser
support and good rendering performance. By automating SVG shape creation that
mimics main features visible inside an image and compressing the result
appropriately, we can achieve SVG-based image placeholders weighing in at only
~400 bytes. SQIP is a tool to make this process easy to integrate into your
deployments.&quot; <br>&#8212;
