&quot;The website won’t be running on WordPress anymore; in fact, it won’t have
a back end at all. We are moving to a JAMstack: articles published directly to
Netlify CDNs, with a custom shop based on an open-sourced headless E-Commerce
GoCommerce and a job board that’s all just static HTML; content editing with
Netlify’s new open-source, Git-Based CMS, real-time search powered by Algolia,
full HTTP/2 support, and the whole website running as a progressive web app with
a service worker in the background (thanks to the awesome Service Worker Toolbox
library)&quot; <br>&#8212;
