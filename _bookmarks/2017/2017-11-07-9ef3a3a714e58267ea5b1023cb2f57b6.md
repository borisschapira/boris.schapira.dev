&quot;The browser needs to get faster. The first browser was created almost 30
years ago. Since then, the browser has moved from its past as a simple document

applications are testing the limits of current browsers, especially on devices
like smartphones. To support those applications, browsers need to adapt to
modern hardware.&quot; <br>&#8212;
