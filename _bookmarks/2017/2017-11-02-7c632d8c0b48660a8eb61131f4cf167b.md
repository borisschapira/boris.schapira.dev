&quot;This post demonstrates some of the changes we did to improve our search
experience. Combined with a number of optimisations on the back end to improve
the performance of trade search, we were able to get the search results to
appear below one second, even when searching through nearly half a million
vehicles. In a future post, we will look at what changes were needed on the
server side to improve search performance.&quot; <br>&#8212;
