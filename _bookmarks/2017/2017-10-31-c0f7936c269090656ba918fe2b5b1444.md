&quot;Performance matters. Next year, weâ€™re thrilled to venture to London for
our brand new conference fully dedicated to everything front-end performance.
Dealing with ads, third-party scripts, A/B testing, HTTP/2, debugging, JAM
stack, PWA, web fonts loading, memory/CPU perf, service workers. Plus lightning
community talks.&quot; <br>&#8212;
