&quot;Do we want the web to be open, accessible, empowering and collaborative?
Free, in the spirit of CERN’s decision in 1993 or the open source tools it's
built on? Or do we want it to be just another means of endless consumption,
where people become eyeballs, targets and profiles? Where companies use your
data to control your behaviour and which enables a surveillance society — what
do we want?&quot; <br>&#8212;
