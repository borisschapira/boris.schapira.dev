&quot;We can do that by utilizing Lazy Loading. Lazy loading is a great way to
optimize your site, and it does that by splitting your code at logical
breakpoints, and then loading it once the user has done something that requires,
or will require, a new block of code. This speeds up the initial load of the
application and lightens its overall weight as some blocks may never even be
loaded.&quot; <br>&#8212;
