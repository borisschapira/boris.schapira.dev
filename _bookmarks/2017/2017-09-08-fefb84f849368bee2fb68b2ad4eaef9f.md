&quot;I want to be very clear: I believe AMP is a framework designed with good
intentions, aimed at solving the very real problem of a web thatâ€™s gotten far,
far too slow for its users. But using AMP? The cost for the web, and for those
who do business on it, is much, much too high.&quot; <br>&#8212;
