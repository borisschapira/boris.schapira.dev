&quot;First came a commitment to writing high-quality code. That required our
programmers to think like minimalists. After that we moved to what the industry
calls continuous deployment, or non-stop micro-product releases of new features,
updates, maintenance and more. Real-time and comprehensive QA are also part of
the process. Gone is that enterprise tech ethos of drumroll-release dates that
are many months if not years apart. For the PWA, our journalists needed to
stretch themselves beyond a century-old reliance on the 800-word story.&quot;
