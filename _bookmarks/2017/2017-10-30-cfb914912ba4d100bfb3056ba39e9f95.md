&quot;That’s a particularly low blow, because it’s such a bait’n’switch. One of
the reasons why AMP first appeared to be different to Facebook Instant Articles
or Apple News was the promise that you could host your AMP pages yourself.
That’s the very reason I first got interested in AMP. But if you actually want
the benefits of AMP—appearing in the not-search-results carousel, pre-rendered
performance, etc.—then your pages must be hosted by Google.&quot; <br>&#8212;
