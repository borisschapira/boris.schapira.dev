&quot;Netflix uses React on the client and server, but they identified that the
client-side portion wasn't needed for the first interaction, so they leaned on
what the browser can already do, and deferred client-side React. The story isn't
that they're abandoning React, it's that they're able to defer it on the client
until it's was needed. React folks should be championing this as a
feature.&quot; <br>&#8212;
