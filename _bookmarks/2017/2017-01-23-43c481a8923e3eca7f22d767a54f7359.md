&quot;The good news is that our old rule of thumb—start at 16pt—is still a
pretty good one, at least for users on laptops, desktops and phones. But if you
are designing for a conference room PC, no text should ever be smaller than 26pt
Arial, and most text should be at least 33pt.&quot; <br>&#8212;
