-   Don’t use ARIA menu semantics in navigation menu systems.<br />
-   On content heavy sites, don’t hide structure away in nested dropdown-powered
    navigation menus.<br />
-   Use aria-expanded to indicate the open/closed state of a button-activated
    navigation menu.<br />
-   Make sure said navigation menu is next in focus order after the button that
    opens/closes it.<br />
-   Never sacrifice usability in the pursuit of JavaScript-free solutions. It’s
    vanity. <br>&#8212;
