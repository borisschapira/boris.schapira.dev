&quot;The paint timing API enables website creators to track and monitor the
important metrics which affects perceived performance. Consider that 53% of
users will abandon a site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load (source).
Being able to keep your paint times low is likely to keep your users happy and
improve the perceived performance of your site.&quot; <br>&#8212;
