&quot;Some JavaScript engines, such as V8 (Chrome) do not optimize functions
that make use of a try/catch block as the optimizing compiler will skip it when
encountered. No matter what context you use a try/catch block in, there will
always be an inherent performance hit, quite possibly a substantial one.&quot;
