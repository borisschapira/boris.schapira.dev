HTTPie is a command line HTTP client whose goal is to make CLI interaction with
web services as human-friendly as possible. It provides a simple http command
that allows for sending arbitrary HTTP requests with a simple and natural
syntax, and displays colorized responses. HTTPie can be used for testing,
debugging, and generally interacting with HTTP servers. <br>&#8212;
