&quot;It's almost impossible to find a website anymore that doesn't utilize any
kind of embedded widgets such as ads, social plugins or analytics. Publishers
don't have much control over the provider's code and inevitable just have to
trust their integrity, content security policy, code quality and performance.
<br /> The performance and availability of 3rd party scripts don't have to
become a worry for publishers. Barbara's talk will not only outline best
practices, tools and tricks on how to sandbox 3rd party scripts but also help
the audience understand bottlenecks, determine potential risks, and elaborate on
how to measure their performance.&quot; <br>&#8212;
