&quot;At GitHub, we're building the text editor we've always wanted. A tool you
can customize to do anything, but also use productively on the first day without
ever touching a config file. Atom is modern, approachable, and hackable to the
core. We can't wait to see what you build with it.&quot; <br>&#8212;
