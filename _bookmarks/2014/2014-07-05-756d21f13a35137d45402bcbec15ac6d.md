<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;It's almost impossible to find a website anymore that doesn't utilize any kind of embedded widgets such as ads, social plugins or analytics. Publishers don't have much control over the provider's code and inevitable just have to trust their integrity, content security policy, code quality and performance.<br />
The performance and availability of 3rd party scripts don't have to become a worry for publishers. Barbara's talk will not only outline best practices, tools and tricks on how to sandbox 3rd party scripts but also help the audience understand bottlenecks, determine potential risks, and elaborate on how to measure their performance.&quot;
