&quot;I’ve been using Promises in my JavaScript code for a while now. They can
be a little brain bending at first. I now use them pretty effectively, but when
it came down to it, I didn’t fully understand how they work. This article is my
resolution to that. If you stick around until the end, you should understand
Promises well too.&quot; <br>&#8212;
