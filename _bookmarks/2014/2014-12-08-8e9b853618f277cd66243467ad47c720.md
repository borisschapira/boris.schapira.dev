<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Coming from a sane language you might think that this in JavaScript is kind of like this in an object oriented language like Java, something that refers to values stored in instance properties. Not so. In JavaScript it is best to think of the this as a boggart carrying a bag of data with an undetectable extension charm.&quot;
