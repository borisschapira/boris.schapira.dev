&gt; Variable fonts reduce the overall combined file size and automatically
reduce the number of network requests by simply being a variable font.<br />
&gt; Even if you consider the slightly larger file sizes, when combined with
improved font compression formats like WOFF2, font subsetting and font loading
techniques like `font-display: swap;` we end up in a situation where we can
still get smaller overall font file sizes as well as a significant increase in
stylistic opportunity. <br>&#8212;
