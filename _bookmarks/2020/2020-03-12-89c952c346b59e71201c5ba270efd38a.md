<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>I love improvements that just work without any effort required of website owners. […] The less friction we can add to introduce these improvements, the more likely they will be adopted, and there’s no better friction than none at all! Fixing the impact of layout shifts on users for responsive images seems to be one such improvement and the web is all the better for it.
