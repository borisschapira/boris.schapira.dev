&gt; It’s become a trend for developers to reach for frameworks on every single
project. Some people are of the mindset that separating HTML and JavaScript is
obsolete, but this isn’t true. For a simple static website that doesn’t need
much user interaction, it’s not worth the trouble. The more enthusiastic React
fans might disagree with me here, but if all your JavaScript is doing is
creating a non-interactive webpage, you shouldn’t be using JavaScript.
JavaScript doesn’t load as fast as regular HTML, so if you’re not getting a
significant developer experience or code reliability improvement, it’s doing
more harm than good. <br>&#8212;
