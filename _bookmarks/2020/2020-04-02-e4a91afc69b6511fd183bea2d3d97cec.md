It is not uncommon for experts to be told sometimes: &quot;Google does
this&quot; or &quot;Apple does that&quot; to justify terrible practices. Except
that Apple and Google are just as often wrong as the rest of us. Their notoriety
doesn't make them better, it just increases their level of accountability.
Nothing more but nothing less. <br>&#8212;
