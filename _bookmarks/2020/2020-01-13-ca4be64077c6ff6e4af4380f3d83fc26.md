&gt; Yes it's better to self-host as the performance gains are substantial […]
However, Google Fonts is not just a repository of hundreds of free fonts - it is
also a clever delivery mechanism […] There is some complexity involved in this
(which Google Fonts handles for you) but with WOFF2-only being a realistic
option now, and good support of most techniques with inbuilt fallbacks, this is
easier than it used to be. <br>&#8212;
