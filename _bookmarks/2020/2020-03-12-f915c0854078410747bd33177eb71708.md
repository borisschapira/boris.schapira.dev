<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Variable fonts reduce the overall combined file size and automatically reduce the number of network requests by simply being a variable font.<br />
Even if you consider the slightly larger file sizes, when combined with improved font compression formats like WOFF2, font subsetting and font loading techniques like <code>font-display: swap;</code> we end up in a situation where we can still get smaller overall font file sizes as well as a significant increase in stylistic opportunity.
