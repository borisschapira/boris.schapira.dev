&gt; Sadly, I think the current state of “modern” web development reverses that
principle. Developer efficiency is prized above all else. Like I said, that
would be absolutely fine if we’re talking about technologies that only
developers are exposed to, but as soon as we’re talking about shipping those
technologies over the network to end users, it’s negligent to continue to
prioritise the developer experience. <br>&#8212;
