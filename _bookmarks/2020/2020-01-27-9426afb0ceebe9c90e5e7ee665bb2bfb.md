&gt; Performance improvements are a never-ending journey. The key is to strike
the right balance. As noted above, we made significant progress on speed
in 2019. But that is not the end of the story. Going forward, we have put a few

_ Synthetic monitoring to check budgets before each release<br /> &gt; _
Adaptive speed budgets<br /> &gt; _ RUM and interactivity metrics (FID, TTI)
