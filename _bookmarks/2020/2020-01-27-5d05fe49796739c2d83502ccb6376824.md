<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Performance improvements are a never-ending journey. The key is to strike the right balance. As noted above, we made significant progress on speed in 2019. But that is not the end of the story. Going forward, we have put a few things in place that will always keep us on the edge when it comes to performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>A committee of Speed Champions</li>
<li>Synthetic monitoring to check budgets before each release</li>
<li>Adaptive speed budgets</li>
<li>RUM and interactivity metrics (FID, TTI)<br />
</li>
</ul>
