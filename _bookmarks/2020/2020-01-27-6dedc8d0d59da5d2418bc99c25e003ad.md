&gt; […] these checks don’t come for free. They can have a significant impact on
web performance depending on what browser a user is using, and the location they
are browsing from. And if a site uses an EV certificate, it is forcing the most
popular browser on the planet (Chrome) to open a revocation check, which will
have an impact on performance for those users who visit your site using it. It
makes you wonder if the ‘perceived’ advantages of using an EV certificate are
really worth it? Personally, I don’t see any advantages, only disadvantages.
