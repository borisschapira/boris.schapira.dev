&gt; In this post, I’ll discuss what I did at ALDO to measure the revenue impact
of web performance _without_ having to spend time making performance
improvements.<br /> &gt; […]<br /> &gt; Back in October, rendering performance
was something we had never focused on. Nobody was really talking about it, so
there must be nothing there. It was only after we started measuring that we saw
the potential. <br>&#8212;
