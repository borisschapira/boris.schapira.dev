&gt; This leads to a situation for users that’s almost worse than before.
Instead of staring at a blank screen, now they get HTML lickety-split—excellent!
But if they try to interact with what’s on screen, they’ll find that nothing is
working yet. Even worse, once the JavaScript is delivered, and is being parsed,
they probably can’t even scroll—their device is too busy interpreting all that
JavaScript. Your users suffer. <br>&#8212;
