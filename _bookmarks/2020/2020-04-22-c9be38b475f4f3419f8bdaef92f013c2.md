&gt; Good frameworks should provide a better starting point on the essentials
(security, accessibility, performance) or have built-in constraints that make it
harder to ship something that violates those.<br /> &gt; <br /> &gt; That
doesnâ€™t appear to be happening with performance (nor with accessibility,
apparently). <br>&#8212;
