<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The tools to make our websites fast and accessible are here but we’re not using them. And that’s what makes me mad […] it’s not just bad software design and development if a website is slow. Performance and accessibility aren’t features that can linger at the bottom of a Jira board to be considered later when it’s convenient.
