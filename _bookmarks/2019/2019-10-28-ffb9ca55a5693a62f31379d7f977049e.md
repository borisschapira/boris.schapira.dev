<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The crossorigin attribute, when used with rel=&quot;preconnect&quot;, doesn't describe <em>where the target origin is</em> but rather <em>what kind of assets will be downloaded from that origin</em>. If the assets use CORS, crossorigin is needed. If CORS won't be used, crossorigin should be omitted. If both types of assets will be present, two resource hints are necessary.
