&gt; **Our current generation of frameworks makes off-main-thread architectures
hard and diminishes its returns**. UI frameworks are supposed to do UI work and
therefore have the right to run on the UI thread. In reality, however, the work
they are doing is a mixture of UI work and other related, but ultimately non-UI
work. <br>&#8212;
