&gt; Since the beginning, Google has insisted AMP is the best solution for the
web’s performance problem. And Google’s used its market dominance to force
publishers to adopt the framework, going so far as to suggest that AMP’s the
only format you need to publish pages on the web. But we’ve reached a point
where AMP may “solve” the web’s performance issues by supercharging the web’s
accessibility problem, excluding even more people from accessing the content
they deserve. <br>&#8212;
