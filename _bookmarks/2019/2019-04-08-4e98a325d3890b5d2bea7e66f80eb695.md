&quot;For most developers, code caching should “just work”. It works best, like
any cache, when things stay unchanged, and works on heuristics which can change
between versions. Nevertheless, code caching does have behaviors that can be
used, and limitations which can be avoided, and careful analysis using
chrome://tracing can help you tweak and optimize the use of caches by your web
app.&quot; <br>&#8212;
