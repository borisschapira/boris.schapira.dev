&quot;ResourceTiming exposes accurate performance metrics for all of the
resources fetched on your page. You can use this data for a variety of
scenarios, from investigating the performance of your third-party libraries to
taking specific actions when resources arenâ€™t performing according to your
performance goals.&quot; <br>&#8212;
