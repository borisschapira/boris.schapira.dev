&gt; The tools to make our websites fast and accessible are here but we’re not
using them. And that’s what makes me mad […] it’s not just bad software design
and development if a website is slow. Performance and accessibility aren’t
features that can linger at the bottom of a Jira board to be considered later
when it’s convenient. <br>&#8212;
