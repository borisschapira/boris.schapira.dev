&gt; To make this risk-score system work accurately, website administrators are
supposed to embed reCaptcha v3 code on all of the pages of their website, not
just on forms or log-in pages. Then, reCaptcha learns over time how their
website’s users typically act, helping the machine learning algorithm underlying
it to generate more accurate risk scores. Because reCaptcha v3 is likely to be
on every page of a website,  if you’re signed into your Google account there’s a
chance Google is getting data about every single webpage you go to that is
embedded with reCaptcha v3—and there many be no visual indication on the site
that it’s happening, beyond a small reCaptcha logo hidden in the corner.
