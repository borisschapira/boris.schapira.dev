&gt; So I often find myself looking at WebPageTest (WPT) waterfall charts, but
as I seem to have the memory of a chimpanzee (not a goldfish, thatâ€™s a myth) I
tend to forget some of the details and what they all mean. So I decided to pull
together many bits of information into a single blog post I can then refer to at
a later date. <br>&#8212;
