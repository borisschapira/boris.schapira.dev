&gt; In this talk, we’ll take a look at unruly or uninvited (third-)party
guests: how to detect them, how to audit them, and how to manage them. We’ll
also look at the different tools available to help us stress-test and quantify
the overhead these third parties bring, and what that means for users and
businesses alike. <br>&#8212;
