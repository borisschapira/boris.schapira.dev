<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;For most developers, code caching should “just work”. It works best, like any cache, when things stay unchanged, and works on heuristics which can change between versions. Nevertheless, code caching does have behaviors that can be used, and limitations which can be avoided, and careful analysis using chrome://tracing can help you tweak and optimize the use of caches by your web app.&quot;
