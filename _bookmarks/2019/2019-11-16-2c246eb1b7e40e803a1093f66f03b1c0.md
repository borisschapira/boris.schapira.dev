&gt; If you do find yourself in a position where your site’s initial rendering
depends on a third-party script, refer to your mitigation plan to see what you
can do to eliminate or ameliorate your dependence on it. Depending on a third
party for core functionality is never a good position to be in, as you’re
relinquishing a lot of control to others who might not have your best interests
in mind. <br>&#8212;
