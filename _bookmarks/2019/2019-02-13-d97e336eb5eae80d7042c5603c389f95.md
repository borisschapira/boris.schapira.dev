I tested 26 Chrome extensions to measure their impact on CPU consumption, page
download size, and user experience.<br /> <br /> Key findings:<br /> <br />
Grammarly and Honey are super slow!<br /> The performance impact of individual
extensions is usually outweighed by the site being loaded, but they increase
power consumption and having many extensions installed adds up<br /> Extension
developers can score easy wins by following best practices <br>&#8212;
