<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>So I often find myself looking at WebPageTest (WPT) waterfall charts, but as I seem to have the memory of a chimpanzee (not a goldfish, thatâ€™s a myth) I tend to forget some of the details and what they all mean. So I decided to pull together many bits of information into a single blog post I can then refer to at a later date.
