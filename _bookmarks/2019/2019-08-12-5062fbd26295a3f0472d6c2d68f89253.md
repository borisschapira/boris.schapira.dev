&gt; To summarise, using native lazy loading is one of the simplest ways of
providing genuine progressive performance enhancements for your users. It’s not
a perfect solution, but if you’re not already utilising lazy loading and have
lots of images/iframes it’s definitely worth trying out — especially as it’s so
easy to implement! <br>&#8212;
