&quot;With the DNS prefetching flag in Google Chrome on Android enabled, Chrome
scans the page for clickable links and resolves the URLs to IP addresses. By the
time you head to any of the pages, their addresses will have been returned to
your device, mitigating any DNS speed issues — the only bottleneck will be your
own connection. (Optionally, it will use your device’s own DNS servers and won’t
touch Google’s unless you want it to.)&quot; <br>&#8212;
