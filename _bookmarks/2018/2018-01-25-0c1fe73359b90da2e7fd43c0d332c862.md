&quot;Whenever performance testing AMP, keep in mind that a test from origin
will include potentially suboptimal server settings like bad cache headers or
missing image optimizations. Also the biggest speed gain (near instant load
through prerendering) will not be reflected in commonly used performance tools
and metrics.&quot; <br>&#8212;
