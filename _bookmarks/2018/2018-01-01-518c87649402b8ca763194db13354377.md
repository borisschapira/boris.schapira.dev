&quot;Managing your service worker cache invalidation is a key step in making
your progressive web app a rich robust experience. It ensures that the content
your customer sees and interacts with is the freshest content possible. It also
guards your app from overstepping the cache quota and potentially causing a
complete purge of everything you stored.&quot; <br>&#8212;
