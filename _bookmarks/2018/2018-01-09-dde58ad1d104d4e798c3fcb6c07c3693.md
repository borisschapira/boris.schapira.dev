&quot;In a year since Facebook’s blog about Cache-Control Immutable, we can see
that it’s usage has spread beyond Facebook and is being used by a handful of
large 3rd parties and ~4150 additional domains. Across all of the pages in the
HTTP Archive, 2% of requests and 30% of sites appear to include at least 1
immutable response. Additionally, most of the sites that are using it have the
directive set on assets that have a long freshness lifetime.&quot; <br>&#8212;
