<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Due to recently disclosed security vulnerabilities for nearly all computers, you should disable any JavaScript cookie manipulation on your website (e.g. when using the critical CSS technique) by setting your cookies to be SameSite and HttpOnly on the server, as recommended on the Chromium wiki. Otherwise, sensitive data, like session keys, may be exposed to malicious third parties.&quot;
