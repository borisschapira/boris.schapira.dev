&quot;We gave the test to 136 people, and the skeleton screen performed the
worst by all metrics. Users in the skeleton screen group took longer to complete
the task, were more likely to evaluate their wait time negatively (by answering
the first question with “Strongly disagree” or “Moderately disagree”), and
guessed that the wait time had been longer than users who saw the loading
spinner or a blank screen.&quot; <br>&#8212;
