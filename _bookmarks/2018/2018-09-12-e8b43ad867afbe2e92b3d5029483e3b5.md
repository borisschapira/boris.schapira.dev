&quot;Web performance is an intricate topic but well worth the effort. Cutting
down initial network requests through progressive enhancement and lazy loading
is useful to make initial rendering as fast as possible. Showing basic content
first, and then loading enhancements like fonts, media, and scripts later,
brings the user experience in harmony with aesthetic designs and business
goals.&quot; <br>&#8212;
