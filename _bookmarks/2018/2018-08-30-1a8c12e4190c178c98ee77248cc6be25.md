<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;In sum, the prospect of AMP may not be positive for all publishers. Though the technology offers rightly lauded fast page loads, and potential opportunities in new products, with only 34% of publishers seeing a clear boost in traffic and some facing substantial monetization challenges, implementing AMP may come at a high cost for publishers. Those publishers facing revenue challenges might be better served by optimizing their implementation setup on AMP rather than relying on a traffic boost to solve these monetization challenges.&quot;
