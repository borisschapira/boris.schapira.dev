&quot;In a perfect world, none of our sites would ever block the main thread
unnecessarily. We’d all be using web workers to do our non-UI work, and we’d
have shouldYield() and a native Scheduling API) built into the browser.<br />

run non-UI code on the main thread, which leads to unresponsiveness and
jank.&quot; <br>&#8212;
