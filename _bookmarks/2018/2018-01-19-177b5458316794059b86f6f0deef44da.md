TL;DR : Reduce the weight of your files by using optimization strategies that
depend on the content and purpose of your videos ; Optimize streaming by
encoding your videos to serve metadata as soon as possible ; Propose
alternatives to MP4, such as WebM.Be careful with autoplay, consider dedicated
solutions for Full HD and donâ€™t hesitate to hide videos when needed. <br>&#8212;
