<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;This post will perform an honest audit of the entire “cost” of Boomerang on a page that it is measuring. We will review every aspect of Boomerang’s lifecycle, starting with the loader snippet through sending a beacon, and beyond. At each phase, we will try to quantify any overhead (JavaScript, network, etc) it causes. The goal is to be open and transparent about the work Boomerang has to do when measuring the user’s experience.&quot;
