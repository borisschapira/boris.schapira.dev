&quot;In sum, the prospect of AMP may not be positive for all publishers. Though
the technology offers rightly lauded fast page loads, and potential
opportunities in new products, with only 34% of publishers seeing a clear boost
in traffic and some facing substantial monetization challenges, implementing AMP
may come at a high cost for publishers. Those publishers facing revenue
challenges might be better served by optimizing their implementation setup on
AMP rather than relying on a traffic boost to solve these monetization
challenges.&quot; <br>&#8212;
