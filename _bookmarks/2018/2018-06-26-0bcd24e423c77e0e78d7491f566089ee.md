Porthole is a small Javascript library that makes it safe and easy to
communicate with cross domain iFrames. Porthole relies on hidden iFrames (later
referred to a as proxy) to exchange information. The caller sets a url fragment
with the message to pass. The proxy by virtue of being served from the same
origin as the callee, invokes a callback method with an event object that
contains the message read from the url fragment. The message signaling mechanism
is based on a resize event. <br>&#8212;
