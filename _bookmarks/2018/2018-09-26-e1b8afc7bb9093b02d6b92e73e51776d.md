&quot;Accurately measuring layout on the web is hard. There’s no perfect metric
to capture style and layout – or indeed, rendering – even though all three can
impact the user experience just as much as JavaScript.<br /> <br /> However,
it’s important to understand how the HTML5 event loop works, and to place
performance marks at the appropriate points in the component rendering
lifecycle.&quot; <br>&#8212;
