&quot;Looking back over one full year since we started rebuilding our mobile
web, we’re so proud of the experience we’ve created for our users. Not only is
it significantly faster, it’s also our first platform to support right-to-left
languages and “night mode.” Investing in a full-featured PWA has exceeded our
expectations. And we’re just getting started.&quot; <br>&#8212;
