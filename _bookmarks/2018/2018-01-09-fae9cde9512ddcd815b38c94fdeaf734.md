&quot;The HTTP Archive is open source and the raw data is available to download.
If you want, you can download all of the data, process it locally and query it
as much as you want. However, that would require a lot of effort to set up.
Google BigQuery makes this much easier, since the data is already loaded and can
be easily queried. And because of the processing power behind BigQuery, even
some of the most complex queries you write will run extremely fast.&quot;
