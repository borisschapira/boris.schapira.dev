&quot;IntersectionObserver is a very straight-forward technology. It has a
pretty good support in the modern browsers and if you want to implement it for
browsers that still (or wonâ€™t at all) support it, of course, there is a polyfill
for that. But all in all, this is a great technology that allows us to do all
sorts of things related to detecting elements in a viewport while helping to
achieve a really good performance boost.&quot; <br>&#8212;
