<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Gratuitous animation can be seen everywhere and it’s not only limited to amateur designers. As a user it’s easy to spot this kind of animation. It’s the animation that gets in your way. The animation that makes you furrow your brow in frustration as it stands between you an your intended goal.&quot;
