&quot;There's another web out there, a better web hiding just below the surface
of the one we surf from our phones and tablets and laptops every day. A web with
no ads, no endlessly scrolling pages, and no annoying modal windows begging you
to share the site on social media or sign up for a newsletter.&quot; <br>&#8212;
