<div class="markdown"><p>Almost exactly a year ago, our team set out to develop the Ads Manager app.<br />
[...]<br />
It ended up being not only Facebook's first fully React Native app but also the first cross-platform one. In this post, we'd like to share with you how we built this app, how React Native enabled us to move faster, and the lessons we learned.
