Almost exactly a year ago, our team set out to develop the Ads Manager app.
<br /> [...] <br /> It ended up being not only Facebook's first fully React
Native app but also the first cross-platform one. In this post, we'd like to
share with you how we built this app, how React Native enabled us to move
faster, and the lessons we learned. <br>&#8212;
