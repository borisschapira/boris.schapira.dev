I'm deeply convinced that sharing and teaching are the only way to truly understand something. I teach at the [ECV Digital](http://www.ecvdigital.fr/) School but you could have met me before at [Ingésup Bordeaux](http://www.ingesup.com/ "Ingesup"). I  can [speack about a technical subject in exchange of a sandwich](http://www.brownbaglunch.fr/baggers.html#Boris_Schapira_Bordeaux "BrownBagLunch France") and I participated to many conferences, both as attendee, team member or speacker, from Barcelona to Paris. My favorite one is [Sud Web](http://sudweb.fr/ "SudWeb.fr").

I wrote some recognized articles, some of them on the [Clever Age blog](http://blog.clever-age.com/en/) about [A/B testing](http://blog.clever-age.com/en/2015/12/14/conquering-ab-testing/), [advertising](http://blog.clever-age.com/en/2015/12/14/online-advertising-the-current-status/), or [how to operate in China](http://blog.clever-age.com/en/2014/07/28/how-to-operate-in-china/). I also wrote on ["Le Train de 13h37"](https://letrainde13h37.fr/6/scripts-tiers-appels-induits-ne-perdez-pas-le-controle-de-votre-site/ "Scripts tiers et appels induits : ne perdez pas le contrôle de votre site") about loosing control on your own website because of third-party scripts.
