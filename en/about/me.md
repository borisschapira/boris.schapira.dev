## nice to meet you

I'm a french engineer[^1] currently working for [Clever Age](http://www.clever-age.com/en/ "Clever Age"). I accompany my clients on custom developments (both Front-End and Back-End, mainly using PHP and the .NET Framework), project management (both as a project manager or an Agile coach) or during their digital transformation on several projects, sometimes over several years. 

You may have meet me during events or conferences, talking about Service Design, Finance, e-Commerce or the choice of a data management solution : (<abbr lang="en" title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, <abbr lang="en" title="Digital Asset Management">DAM</abbr>, <abbr lang="en" title="Online Video Platform">OVP</abbr>)…

Specializing in Quality management, Web performance and mobile Web, I'm thrilled about understanding the challenges of the new usages and experiences of the users. 

I care a lot, so [I also share a lot](/en/about/sharing/).
